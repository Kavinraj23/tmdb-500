TMDB Movie Revenue Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict movie revenue based on metadata from The Movie Database (TMDB). It applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression modeling to explore how factors like cast, budget, and genre influence box office performance.

Features
Cleaned & merged TMDB metadata and credits datasets
Feature engineering (log transformations, genre encoding, release date parsing)
Model training using XGBoost & Random Forest
SHAP explainability for feature impact analysis
Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ²

Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
SHAP for model explainability
Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualizations
